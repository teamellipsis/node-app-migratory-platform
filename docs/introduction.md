## About
***
[Application Migratory Platform](https://teamellipsis.github.io/node-app-migratory-platform) is an open source research project maintained by [Team-Ellipsis](https://github.com/teamellipsis). This platform will helps to run applications(Only this platform specific migratory applications) with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Motivation
***
#### Limitation of mobile devices
According to [mobile computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing), mobile devices have [limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing#Limitations) such as power limitation, low processing power, unreliable network, display size, etc. To overcome those limitations we can [offload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_offloading) user tasks to another powerful device.

#### Application migration can enhance the usability
Application migration will provide move running application and its working state into another device and continue work in new device. 

New device can be
- more powerful
- portable
- resourceful

than previous device.

#### Lack of existing platforms for cross-platform application migration
Currently there are no user oriented cross-platform application migratory platforms. Existing approches are not provide user oriented platform to migrate applications. The most releted paradigm is [mobile agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_agent) which can move one device to another device autonomously.
